            It's amazing how pervasive food is. Every second commercial is for
            food. Every second TV episode takes place around a meal. In the
            city, you can't go ten feet without seeing or smelling a restaurant.
            There are 20 foot high hamburgers up on billboards. I am acutely
            aware of food, and its omnipresence is astounding.

            Fat is a barrier, a bellicose statement to others that, to some,
            justifies hostility in kind. The world says to the fat person, "Your
            fatness is an affront to me, so we have the right to treat you as
            offensively as you appear." Fat is not merely viewed as another type
            of tissue, but as a diagnostic sign, a personal statement, and a
            measure of personality. Too little fat and we see you as being
            antisocial, fearful and sexless. Too much fat and we see you as
            slothful, stupid, and sexually hung up.

            Fat people, it is commonly held, should be punished because they
            offend our aesthetic sensibilities. They take up too much space on
            subways, buses, airplanes, and elevators. They consume more than
            they contribute to society. They become ill and need to be taken
            care of, or they die early and their families are left unsupported.
            The only way fat people can gain some acceptance and forgiveness for
            their crime of overeating is to at least try, or look like they are
            trying, to lose weight. They must never eat an ice cream cone in
            public, never be seen eating a normal sized portion of non-diet
            food!
